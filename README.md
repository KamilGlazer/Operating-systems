The projects were carried out while studying Computer Science at the Tadeusz Kościuszko University of Technology in Kraków as part of the course Operating Systems. The programs communicate using various IPC mechanisms such as message queues, shared memory, and semaphores. They also utilize pipes and FIFO pipes, perform file operations, leverage system functions, handle signals, and manage error control.
